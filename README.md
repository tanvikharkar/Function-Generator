# Project 2 - Function Generator
The purpose of this project is to design a function generator using a microcontroller. The
microcontroller should be connected with an external DAC to generate the analog waveforms
required. This DAC will have an SPI interface. The waveforms that the function generator must
generate include a saw tooth waveform, a square wave with a variable duty cycle, and a sinusoidal
waveform. The frequency of the waveforms will also be variable. The keypad will be used to select the output waveform type, set the frequency of the waveform and set the duty cycle of the square wave.
